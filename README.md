# pr_bio_2018-2019_assignments
A repository to host the files used by the students of Perspectives in Bioinformatics 2018-2019 class to submit their assignments.

# What I've learned?
This project was developed in the curricular unit "Prespectivas de Bioinformatica" of my Bioinformatics degree.
In this project, I acquired basic knowledge about Linux shell commands and git commands.
I hope it can be useful in the near future.
